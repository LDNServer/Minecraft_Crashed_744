## How to Play

### Client
**Requirements:** Java 8 (Zulu recommended)  
[Download Zulu Java 8](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&os=windows&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk#zulu)  

1. Download the client zip file:  
[Crashed_744.zip](https://github.com/LDNServer/Minecraft_Crashed_744/releases) (the top file)  

2. Install **MultiMC** or **PrismLauncher**:  
- [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download)  
- [PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org)  

   After installation, log in with your Minecraft account and **drag & drop** the zip file you downloaded in step 1.  

3. In the installed instance, set Java to the Zulu Java 8 you installed. Adjust memory allocation if necessary, then click **Launch**.

### Server
1. Download the Minecraft 1.1 server jar:  
[1.1.jar](https://files.betacraft.uk/server-archive/release/1.1/1.1.jar)  

2. Download the Crashed_744 server zip:  
[Crashed_744_server.zip](https://github.com/LDNServer/Minecraft_Crashed_744/releases)  

3. Extract `1.1.jar` into a folder, then **copy all contents of `Crashed_744_server.zip` into this folder, overwriting files**.  

4. Optionally repackage the folder into a jar and start the server. If it shows **Minecraft Crashed 744**, setup is complete.
